Homework for week three

# This homework is an Indiana Jones themed hangman game.

I tried to find a similar font to display the text in an Indiana Jones theme. I also chose an array of words that are taken from key moments and lines from the movies.

## When the game begins the user can press any key to start guessing their hidden word.
The guesses are logged on the screen and a countdown begins with how many guesses they have remaining before the game is over.

## On a correct guess
The letter chosen will appear in the correct place on the screen and replace the underscore.

## When the game is over because the user runs out of guesses
They will be told that it "Looks like Indy is in trouble..." and be given a choice to play again.

## When the game is over because the user guesses the word correctly
They are congratulated and a memorable quip from the movie series will show up on the page. Again they will be asked if they would like to play again.

They tally of wins and losses is stored on the page until the page is refreshed.

### Please enjoy hangman themed with pieces from everyone's favorite archaeologist.
